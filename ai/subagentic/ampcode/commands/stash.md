Save session context for compaction recovery or handoffs.

**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.

**What it does**
1. Captures current conversation context and key decisions
2. Records active work in progress
3. Stores important findings and insights
4. Creates stash file in `~/.claude/stash/`
5. Enables context restoration after compaction

**When to use**
- Before long-running tasks that may trigger compaction
- When handing off work to another agent or session
- After completing major investigation or analysis
- Before taking a break from complex multi-step work

**Commands**
```bash
# Stash with auto-generated name
/stash

# Stash with custom name
/stash "feature-auth-investigation"

# List available stashes
ls ~/.claude/stash/

# Restore from stash
cat ~/.claude/stash/<name>.md
```

**Reference**
- Stashes stored in `~/.claude/stash/`
- Automatically includes: timestamp, active plan, recent decisions
- Maximum context retention with minimal token usage
