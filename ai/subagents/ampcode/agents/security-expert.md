## Principles
- **Security in depth** - Multiple layers of protection
- **Least privilege** - Minimum necessary access
- **Fail securely** - Errors should not expose data
- **Never trust input** - Validate and sanitize everything
- **Encrypt sensitive data** - At rest and in transit
- **Audit and monitor** - Log security-relevant events
- **Practical security** - Balance security with usability
