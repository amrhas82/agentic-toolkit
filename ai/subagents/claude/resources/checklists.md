## Architect Checklist {#architect-checklist}


# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before development execution. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the architecture is robust, scalable, secure, and aligned with the product requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document for requirements alignment (check docs/prd.md)
3. frontend-architecture.md or fe-architecture.md - If this is a UI project (check docs/frontend-architecture.md)
4. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
5. API documentation if available
6. Technology stack details and version specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Does the architecture include a frontend/UI component?
- Is there a frontend-architecture.md document?
- Does the PRD mention user interfaces or frontend requirements?

If this is a backend-only or service-only project:

- Skip sections marked with [[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Focus extra attention on API design, service architecture, and integration patterns
- Note in your final report that frontend sections were skipped due to project type

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. REQUIREMENTS ALIGNMENT

[[LLM: Before evaluating this section, take a moment to fully understand the product's purpose and goals from the PRD. What is the core problem being solved? Who are the users?

## Change Checklist {#change-checklist}


# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the Agentic Kit workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - CHANGE NAVIGATION

Changes during development are inevitable, but how we handle them determines project success or failure.

Before proceeding, understand:

1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes that affect the project direction
2. Minor adjustments within a story don't require this process
3. The goal is to minimize wasted work while adapting to new realities
4. User buy-in is critical - they must understand and approve changes

Required context:

- The triggering story or issue
- Current project state (completed stories, current epic)
- Access to PRD, architecture, and other key documents
- Understanding of remaining work planned

APPROACH:
This is an interactive process with the user. Work through each section together, discussing implications and options. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert guidance on technical feasibility and impact.

REMEMBER: Changes are opportunities to improve, not failures. Handle them professionally and constructively.]]

---

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

[[LLM: Start by fully understanding what went wrong and why. Don't jump to solutions yet. Ask probing questions:

- What exactly happened that triggered this review?
- Is this a one-time issue or symptomatic of a larger problem?
- Could this have been anticipated earlier?
- What assumptions were incorrect?

Be specific and factual, not blame-oriented.]]

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

[[LLM: Changes ripple through the project structure. Systematically evaluate:

1. Can we salvage the current epic with modifications?
2. Do future epics still make sense given this change?
3. Are we creating or eliminating dependencies?
4. Does the epic sequence need reordering?

Think about both immediate and downstream effects.]]

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Summarize Epic Impact:** Briefly document the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

[[LLM: Documentation drives development in Agentic Kit. Check each artifact:

1. Does this change invalidate documented decisions?
2. Are architectural assumptions still valid?
3. Do user flows need rethinking?
4. Are technical constraints different than documented?

Be thorough - missed conflicts cause future problems.]]

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Summarize Artifact Impact:** List all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

[[LLM: Present options clearly with pros/cons. For each path:

1. What's the effort required?
2. What work gets thrown away?
3. What risks are we taking?
4. How does this affect timeline?
5. Is this sustainable long-term?

Be honest about trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution.]]

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

[[LLM: The proposal must be actionable and clear. Ensure:

1. The issue is explained in plain language
2. Impacts are quantified where possible
3. The recommended path has clear rationale
4. Next steps are specific and assigned
5. Success criteria for the change are defined

This proposal guides all subsequent work.]]

(Ensure all agreed-upon points from previous sections are captured in the proposal)

- [ ] **Identified Issue Summary:** Clear, concise problem statement.
- [ ] **Epic Impact Summary:** How epics are affected.
- [ ] **Artifact Adjustment Needs:** List of documents to change.
- [ ] **Recommended Path Forward:** Chosen solution with rationale.
- [ ] **PRD MVP Impact:** Changes to scope/goals (if any).
- [ ] **High-Level Action Plan:** Next steps for stories/updates.
- [ ] **Agent Handoff Plan:** Identify roles needed (product-manager, Arch, Design Arch, PO).

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

[[LLM: Changes require coordination. Before concluding:

1. Is the user fully aligned with the plan?
2. Do all stakeholders understand the impacts?
3. Are handoffs to other agents clear?
4. Is there a rollback plan if the change fails?
5. How will we validate the change worked?

Get explicit approval - implicit agreement causes problems.

FINAL REPORT:
After completing the checklist, provide a concise summary:

- What changed and why
- What we're doing about it
- Who needs to do what
- When we'll know if it worked

Keep it action-oriented and forward-looking.]]

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents.

## Po Master Checklist {#po-master-checklist}


# Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PO MASTER CHECKLIST

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

1. Is this a GREENFIELD project (new from scratch)?
   - Look for: New project initialization, no existing codebase references
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, new project setup stories

2. Is this a BROWNFIELD project (enhancing existing system)?
   - Look for: References to existing codebase, enhancement/modification language
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, existing system analysis

3. Does the project include UI/UX components?
   - Check for: frontend-architecture.md, UI/UX specifications, design files
   - Look for: Frontend stories, component specifications, user interface mentions

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For GREENFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The Product Requirements Document
- architecture.md - The system architecture
- frontend-architecture.md - If UI/UX is involved

For BROWNFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The brownfield enhancement requirements
- architecture.md - The enhancement architecture
- Existing project codebase access (CRITICAL - cannot proceed without this)
- Current deployment configuration and infrastructure details

## Story Draft Checklist {#story-draft-checklist}


# Story Draft Checklist

The Scrum Master should use this checklist to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DRAFT VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. The story document being validated (usually in docs/stories/ or provided directly)
2. The parent epic context
3. Any referenced architecture or design documents
4. Previous related stories if this builds on prior work

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates individual stories BEFORE implementation begins.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Clarity - A developer should understand WHAT to build
2. Context - WHY this is being built and how it fits
3. Guidance - Key technical decisions and patterns to follow
4. Testability - How to verify the implementation works
5. Self-Contained - Most info needed is in the story itself

REMEMBER: We assume competent developer agents who can:

- Research documentation and codebases
- Make reasonable technical decisions
- Follow established patterns
- Ask for clarification when truly stuck

We're checking for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail.]]

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

[[LLM: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify:

1. The story states WHAT functionality to implement
2. The business value or user benefit is clear
3. How this fits into the larger epic/product is explained
4. Dependencies are explicit ("requires Story X to be complete")
5. Success looks like something specific, not vague]]

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check:

1. Key files/components to create or modify are mentioned
2. Technology choices are specified where non-obvious
3. Integration points with existing code are identified
4. Data models or API contracts are defined or referenced
5. Non-standard patterns or exceptions are called out

Note: We don't need every file listed - just the important ones.]]

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

[[LLM: References should help, not create a treasure hunt. Ensure:

1. References point to specific sections, not whole documents
2. The relevance of each reference is explained
3. Critical information is summarized in the story
4. References are accessible (not broken links)
5. Previous story context is summarized if needed]]

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

[[LLM: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify:

1. Core requirements are in the story, not just in references
2. Domain terms are explained or obvious from context
3. Assumptions are stated explicitly
4. Edge cases are mentioned (even if deferred)
5. The story could be understood without reading 10 other documents]]

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Testing ensures the implementation actually works. Check:

1. Test approach is specified (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Key test scenarios are listed
3. Success criteria are measurable
4. Special test considerations are noted
5. Acceptance criteria in the story are testable]]

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

1. Quick Summary
   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:
   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)
   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work down and not create a mess.]]
