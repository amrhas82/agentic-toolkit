# Global Droid Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for your coding CLI.

# Droid CLI subagents and Tasks (Droid)

Droid reads AGENTS.md when other subagents want to invoke other subagents, tasks, or resources

## How To Use With Droid

Activate agents by mentioning their ID in your prompts:
- `"As full-stack-dev, implement the login feature"`
- `"invoke droid qa-test-architect"`

- Copy/paste `droid` subfolders in this project to ~/.factory and droid will read and access agents from ~/.factory/droids and tasks from ~/.factory/resources/tasks-brief.md,
- You can access agents using "@ux-expert", or you can reference a role naturally, e.g., "As ux-expert, implement ..." or use commands defined in your tasks.

Note
- Orchestrators/master run as mode: primary; other agents as mode: subagents.
- All agents have enbaled tools: write, edit, bash.
