## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Build a New Feature (3-Phase Workflow)

```
# Claude Code / OpenCode / Amp
As 1-create-prd, create a PRD for user authentication with email/password and OAuth support

[Review PRD, make adjustments]

As 2-generate-tasks, break down this PRD into actionable tasks

[Review task list]

As 3-process-task-list, implement tasks one by one, pausing for my review after each
```

### Example 2: Use Specialist Agents

```
# Architecture Design
As architect, design a microservices architecture for this e-commerce platform

# Implementation
As developer, implement the user service based on the architecture

# Quality Review
As qa-engineer, review this implementation for production readiness

# Security Audit (Amp only)
As security-expert, audit this authentication system for vulnerabilities
```

### Example 3: Orchestrated Workflow

```
As orchestrator, implement complete user registration:
1. Have architect design the system
2. Spawn developer for backend API
3. Spawn developer for frontend UI
4. Have qa-engineer validate
5. Have security-expert audit (Amp)
6. Have devops-engineer create CI/CD (Amp)
```

### Example 4: Use Tasks (Claude/OpenCode Only)

```
# Execute a specific task
Execute task: create-next-story from this epic

# Run quality gate
Execute task: qa-gate for story-001

# Generate documentation
Execute task: document-project for current codebase
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Modifying Agents

Each agent is defined in a markdown file. You can customize:

**For Claude/OpenCode:**
```bash
# Edit agent definition
nano ~/.claude/agents/developer.md
# or
nano ~/.config/opencode/agents/developer.md
```

**For Amp:**
```bash
# Edit agent definition
nano ~/.amp/agents/developer.md
```

### Creating New Agents

Use the existing agents as templates:

1. Copy an existing agent file
2. Modify the persona, capabilities, and principles
3. Save with a new name
4. Invoke using the new agent ID

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Use Each Kit

**Use Claude Subagents if:**
- You use Claude Code as your primary AI tool
- You want the @agent-name invocation style
- You need the 22 reusable tasks

**Use OpenCode Subagents if:**
- You use OpenCode as your primary AI tool
- You prefer natural language invocation
- You need the 22 reusable tasks

**Use Amp Subagents if:**
- You use Amp as your primary AI tool
- You need the 6 additional technical specialists
- You don't need the pre-built tasks

### Workflow Tips

1. **Start with workflow agents** (1-2-3) for structured development
2. **Use specialists** for specific technical needs
3. **Leverage orchestrator** for complex multi-step tasks
4. **Mix and match** - switch agents as needed during development

### Common Patterns

**Feature Development:**
```
1-create-prd → 2-generate-tasks → 3-process-task-list → qa-engineer
```

**Architecture to Implementation:**
```
architect → developer → qa-engineer → devops-engineer (Amp)
```

**Research to Build:**
```
researcher (Amp) → architect → developer → technical-writer (Amp)
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Found

**Problem**: AI tool doesn't recognize agents

**Solutions:**
- Verify files copied to correct location (`~/.claude/`, `~/.config/opencode/`, or `~/.amp/`)
- Restart your AI tool
- Check file permissions: `chmod -R 644 ~/.claude/agents/*` (or equivalent)

### Agent Not Behaving as Expected

**Problem**: Agent responses don't match specialization

**Solutions:**
- Check agent file isn't corrupted: `cat ~/.claude/agents/developer.md`
- Re-copy from original: `cp -r ai/claude/* ~/.claude/`
- Ensure you're using correct invocation: `As developer, ...` or `@developer`

### Task Not Working (Claude/OpenCode)

**Problem**: Tasks not executing

**Solutions:**
- Verify tasks directory exists: `ls ~/.claude/tasks/`
- Check task reference in agent files
- Some tasks depend on other files (templates, checklists) - ensure full copy
