## Detailed Section Breakdown

### âœ… Completed Sections (0-7)

**Section 0: The Agentic Field - What You're Actually Getting Into**
- Three Tiers of AI Assistance (Chat AI, Code Agents, Agentic Workflows)
- The path most beginners take (and why it fails)
- Uncomfortable truth about AI coding (what AI removes vs what it doesn't)
- Hidden traps: UI trap, context windows, possible tuning, sunk cost trap
- How successful non-coders actually do this (month-by-month progression)
- Real wisdom from experience (price shocks, tool diversity, CLI benefits, GitHub from Day 1)

**Section 1: The UI Trap - Why Most Beginners Fail**
- Week-by-week failure pattern (honeymoon â†’ cracks â†’ spiral â†’ wall)
- Why it happens: the invisible 90% (database, auth, error handling vs UI)
- The delusion of progress (80% UI complete â‰  80% app complete)
- Back-to-back prompting death spiral
- Context window reality during the trap
- Feature creep and MVP death
- The $1,000 mistake (real costs breakdown)
- When to restart vs keep fixing
- Critical AI problem: models won't tell you to stop
- How to actually avoid the trap

**Section 2: Your First 48 Hours - Practical Starting Plan**
- Hours 0-2: Tool setup (OS choice, AI tool selection, access methods)
- Hours 2-4: Free model access (OpenCode CLI, OpenRouter, free tiers)
- Hours 4-6: GitHub setup (Day 1, not eventually)
- Hours 6-8: The 3-step method (templates that guide agents)
- Hours 8-24: Execute first project (simplest, silliest thing)
- Hours 24-48: Core first, UI last (if not working ugly, won't work beautiful)
- 48-hour checklist (7+ items = on track)
- Red flags vs green flags
- Budget reality ($0, $20, $40 options)

**Section 3: Model Landscape - Western vs Chinese, Pricing, 50/50 Framework**
- The 50/50 framework (structure + right model mix)
- Three access methods: CLI, IDE, Web
- Western vs Chinese models (engagement training vs directness training)
- Model personalities (DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, GLM, Gemini)
- Real setup example ($40/month multi-tool strategy)
- Pricing reality (Western API vs Chinese API costs)
- Free tier viability (DeepSeek, GLM, Gemini, Grok, Poe)
- Anti-vendor lock-in philosophy
- 5-hour reset as feature, not limitation

**Section 4: Temperature Explained - Control Without Changing Personality**
- What temperature actually is (randomness control, NOT personality)
- Temperature scale (0.0-0.3 deterministic, 0.5-0.7 balanced, 1.2-1.5 creative, 1.8-2.0 chaotic)
- Real examples: Restaurant review bot, yoga planning bot at 0.5
- Core tradeoff (consistency vs creativity)
- When to use low temperature (specialized agents, one job)
- When to use high temperature (strategic, creative roles)
- Failure modes of high temperature (breaking character, context bloat, customer frustration)
- Web vs CLI differences (hidden vs visible control)
- Temperature vs personality: they're orthogonal
- Guardrailing reduction: 50% â†’ 1-2% with persona MD files

**Section 5: Access Methods Deep Dive - Why CLI Changes Everything**
- The problem with web (Replit time breakdown: 50% guardrailing, 25% fixing, 25% exhausted)
- CLI transformation (50% guardrailing â†’ 1-2% with @subagent invocation)
- Why CLI won (repo control, local testing, context visibility, agent invocation)
- The 5-hour reset as feature (forces planning, prevents spirals)
- Persona MD files replace constant guardrailing
- Web vs CLI vs Plugin comparison
- OpenRouter + OpenCode free tier strategy
- GLM comparable to Claude at fraction of price
- Kilocode plugin: similar to CLI but GUI overhead

**Section 6: Approaches Spectrum - Finding the Right Structure**
- Manual PM workflow: DeepSeek research â†’ OneNote tracking â†’ Replit execution (exhausting)
- The breakthrough: 3-step + Claude CLI
- Guardrailing shift: 50% â†’ 1-2% with agent-driven planning
- When vibecoding works vs fails (single file vs multi-file)
- Three approaches: Vibecoding, 3-Step, BMAD Hybrid
- BMAD compaction (22 tasks â†’ 13 subagents optimized)
- Why Replit failed (can't invoke agents, no repo control, hidden context)
- Real cost shift: $50/day â†’ sustainable monthly
- The real win: agent planning, not manual PM work
- Tool + framework together (framework on bad tool still fails)

**Section 7: Context Windows - The Invisible Constraint**
- Wrong mental model: "preserve memory" by staying in same chat
- What actually happened (Week 4-5: AI starts lying, hallucinating)
- Hallucination symptoms (claimed work done, wrong file, breaks things, forgets, slow, over-apologetic)
- The backwards logic: staying in same window CAUSES hallucinations
- Web hides it, CLI shows it (`/context` command)
- The 75% rule (proactive reset prevents hallucinations)
- Fresh context protocol (continuation doc, 2-3% cost, prevents 20-30% waste)
- Context fill rates (UI changes 1-2%, complex features 3-5%, bug fixes 0.5-1%)
- Precision effect (vague prompts fill context faster)
- Cost comparison (with resets vs without)
- Why tools don't explain this (longer chats = more tokens = more profit)
