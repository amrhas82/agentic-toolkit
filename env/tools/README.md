Hey there! I'm gradually migrating my open-source work to Codeberg to support a community-driven, non-profit platform.
ðŸ”— Find Me On Both Platforms:

    Codeberg: codeberg.org/justaguylinux
    GitHub: Legacy mirror while the last few projects finish migrating
    Migration Status: Most active repos now live on Codeberg, with mirrors here for convenience

ðŸ“º YouTube Viewers:

Most code is still here on GitHub! I'm gradually moving to Codeberg. Check both places for now - links in video descriptions will be updated as repos move.
Why the Move?

    Support truly open-source infrastructure
    Non-profit, community-driven platform
    European privacy standards
    No corporate interests
